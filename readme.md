# Notes on EEG processing with Muse EEG headset

## Lab Streaming Layer or LSL

is a system designed to unify the collection of time
series data for research experiments. It has become standard in the field of
EEG-based brain-computer interfaces for its ability to make seperate streams of
data available on a network with time synchronization and near real-time
access. For more information, check out this lecture from Modern Brain-Computer
Interface Design or the LSL repository

## Dependencies for data collection app

    sudo apt install python3 python3-pip tk-dev python3-tk
    python3 -m pip install tk matplotlib


## Installing MuseLSL python library

https://github.com/alexandrebarachant/muse-lsl
https://github.com/alexandrebarachant/muse-lsl/blob/master/examples/neurofeedback.py

    sudo apt-get install libglfw3-dev libgles2-mesa-dev      // If egl display config issue
    sudo apt install libpcap-dev libpcap0.8 libpcap0.8-dev
    sudo apt install python3-tk
    sudo apt install python3-vispy

    pip install muselsl
    pip install pygatt==3.1.1
    pip install mne


## MuseLSL command line client usage

    muselsl list
    muselsl stream
    muselsl stream --name Muse-7E45             // For some reason auto discovery of visible Muse devices didnt work for me.
    muselsl stream -a "00:55:DA:B5:7E:45"

    muselsl view
    muselsl view --version 2                    // if segfault without --version
    muselsl view --version 2 --window 10

In case bluetooth refuses to turn on after attempted restart:

    sudo rmmod btusb && sudo modprobe btusb && sudo rfkill unblock

## EEG Processing

The electrical potential accross the cell membrane is small, around -70 mV at rest (1000 microvolts in a millivolt), and it changes around -20 mV during electrical changes in the cell.

If a large group of these tiny dipoles are aligned in space and their electrical potentials change at the same time, they can create electrical potentials which are large enough to conduct through the brain tissue and be measurable comparing different points on the head.

Electrical potentials measured on the outside of the head fluctuature between about -200 and 200 Î¼V. You can also see cycles between high and low voltage, called oscillations, which can occur in the human brain at a number of frequencies.

Fluctuations in activity of large groups of neurons seem to occur within certain frequency bands. It is thought that these frequencies are one of the ways the brain uses to process information. These oscillations can change during different behaviours, most notably when we are awake vs when we sleep.

Awake state - High frequency Beta waves.
Sleep state - Larger groups of neurons all fire together at low frequencies called Delta waves.

We use the power of those brain waves (Beta, Delta, and others) to provide neurofeedback or create simple BCI (Brain-Computer Interfaces).

Scalp and skull diffuse the electrical signal from the brain, so measurements performed outside contain very little spatial information about the signal's source. Additionally, each extracranial measurement could be caused by many different configurations of dipoles inside the brain.

EEG electrodes locations are standarized in a regular grid covering the surface of the head.
Each location is designated by a code:
- letter indicating the location of the head (F-Frontal; C-Central; P-Parietal; T-Temporal; O-Occipital; Fp-Fronto-polar).
- The suffix has a 'z' if along the midline, odd numbers over the left hemisphere, and even over the right.
- Numbers start along the midline and get larger for more lateral sites on the head.

Can location of reference electrode affect the signal quality?
How about using multiple reference electrodes?
What if we used each electrode as a reference for all others creating a fully connected graph of electrodes/reference electrodes?
Would more reference electrodes yield more spatial information about the signal source?
