## What is a BCI

"A system which takes a biosignal measured from a person and predicts some aspect of the person's mental state."

1. Active BCI vs Reactive BCI

Active relates to the user controlling consciously its state in order to trigger an effect in the application.
Reactive means that the system observers users reaction to some external event.
