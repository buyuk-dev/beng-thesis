## Lab Streaming Layer or LSL

is a system designed to unify the collection of time
series data for research experiments. It has become standard in the field of
EEG-based brain-computer interfaces for its ability to make seperate streams of
data available on a network with time synchronization and near real-time
access. For more information, check out this lecture from Modern Brain-Computer
Interface Design or the LSL repository
